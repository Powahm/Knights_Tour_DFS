# Knights Tour DFS ♟️
A knight's tour is a sequence of moves by a knight on a chessboard where the knight visits every square exactly once, and doesn't repeat a square.

A closed knight's tour is a special type of knight's tour where the knight returns to its starting square, forming a closed loop. This ensures that the path is both complete and cyclic.

FYI: For the ones who don't know, a knight moves in "L" shapes. Two spaces in one direction, followed by one in a perpendicular direction 😉
